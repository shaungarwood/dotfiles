# dotfiles

`sh -c "$(curl -fsLS get.chezmoi.io)" -- init --apply shaungarwood`

`cm cd`
Probably just do this for most everything. Then run git commands.

`cm diff`
See what changes chezmoi WOULD make

`cm -v apply`
Apply the changes

`cm pull`
I think this will pull GH repo changes.

I don't wannt do `cm update -v` to pull and apply in one fowl swoop.
