## Mise
check out mise
https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html
how much faster/easier is it?
there's a comparison section for mise vs asdf.

mise:
 - bitwarden
 - neovim
 - tmux
 - lazygit
 - tldr
 - ripgrep


## vim
! get a light theme for nvim! and an alias to switch between them

nvim
  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:neovim-ppa/unstable -y

may be able to switch this to brew or mise


## tmux
different colors for different systems


## ssh
add .ssh/config
how to differenciate the different local environments?
maybe just full on different files


## pry
can i use a default on in my home dir?
will it override the one in the project?


## random packages
files to add:
 5. python
   yt-dlp
 6. default packages
 8. nice pryrc?
