# TODO

- adding this to get git working on phone

 - added waybar, but don't have a script to install it yet
 - a bunch of the linux stuff is installing on my mac


## kitty
ubuntu - apt, not brew

## Mise
check out mise
https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html
how much faster/easier is it?
there's a comparison section for mise vs asdf.

mise:
 - bitwarden
 - neovim
 - tmux
 - lazygit
 - tldr
 - ripgrep
 - kitty??


## brew
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
same for linux and mac

==> Next steps:
- Run these two commands in your terminal to add Homebrew to your PATH:
    (echo; echo 'eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"') >> /home/csw/.zshrc
    eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
- Install Homebrew's dependencies if you have sudo access:
    sudo apt-get install build-essential
  For more information, see:
    https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux
- We recommend that you install GCC:
    brew install gcc

do the brew install gcc, even though i had it - i think they need it for other stuff


## vim
! get a light theme for nvim! and an alias to switch between them

nvim
  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:neovim-ppa/unstable -y

may be able to switch this to brew or mise

tpope/rails.vim


## tmux
different colors for different systems


## ssh
add .ssh/config
how to differenciate the different local environments?
maybe just full on different files


## pry
can i use a default on in my home dir?
will it override the one in the project?


## random packages
files to add:
 5. python
   yt-dlp
 6. default packages
 8. nice pryrc?

random:
 - aliases contain gui stuff, veryacrypt, rails
